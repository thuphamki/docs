# Boards Overview

Boards act like customizable command centers. Each one collects the market signals, commentary, and alerts your team needs, so you can scan a single page instead of juggling spreadsheets or inbox threads.

> **Note:** Most people land on a board right after signing in. A clear structure here means fewer clicks to insight.

## What Lives on a Board

- **Columns**: vertical lanes that group cards by workflow (Watchlist, Active Deals, Post-mortem, etc.). Collapse a lane to keep focus when things get busy.
- **Cards**: mini dashboards that show a metric, comparison, or alert. You decide which card sits in which column.

## Columns at a Glance

- **Name clearly**: titles like "Near-term buys" or "Asia shipping" help teammates scan faster.
- **Collapse when needed**: tap the caret on the column header to hide cards you only check occasionally.
- **Reorder freely**: drag the header to move an entire column left or right. The layout is saved automatically for the next visit.

## Adding and Arranging Cards

1. Select **Add card** inside any column.
2. Browse or search for the insight you need (price trend, spread, comparison, gauge, etc.).
3. Fill in the short form—pick the variants, time window, or thresholds—and save. The card appears instantly.
4. Drag cards up or down to prioritize what should be read first. The order syncs for everyone who can view the board.

> **Tip:** Duplicate a card when you just need to tweak the variants or period. It is faster than rebuilding from scratch.

## Keeping Boards Tidy

- Limit a column to roughly eight cards so each one has room to breathe.
- Use the **Add column** button instead of stacking dozens of cards in a single lane.
- Rename or archive stale cards; anything you no longer watch can move to a "Parking lot" column to stay out of sight.
- Empty columns show a gentle placeholder that reminds teammates they can drag cards in—helpful during onboarding.

## When to Start a New Board

Create a fresh board when:

- Different teams (procurement, sales, finance) need their own priorities.
- You track separate regions or commodities that rarely overlap.
- You are preparing an executive briefing and want a clean narrative that will not disturb day-to-day boards.

Label boards clearly and share them with the teammates who need that context. Everyone sees live data, so a single update benefits the entire group.
