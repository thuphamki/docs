# Pricenxt Documentation

This directory mirrors the core Mintlify docs but in plain Markdown so GitBook can render them. Each concept lives under `pricenxt/` and can be referenced from GitBook's navigation.

Use this page as the landing section when syncing the repo with GitBook. Update the links below as more guides are added.

- [Boards overview](pricenxt/boards.md)
- [Cards and card types](pricenxt/cards.md)
- [Price history chart](pricenxt/price-history-chart.md)
