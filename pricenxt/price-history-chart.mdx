## What the chart shows

The price history chart is the hero of every Insight page. It blends:

- Historical **spot** or **monthly** prices (depending on what the selected variant supports).
- Optional **forecasts** that extend the line forward so you can see where analysts expect the trend to go.
- A **bandwidth envelope** that hints at the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios.
- Compact **delta badges** that spell out how much the price moved over the window you selected.

Everything is updated live, so you can trust it in meetings and exports.

## Reading the layers

- **Solid line**: actual traded or published prices. Hover any point to see the exact value and the time stamp in your locale.
- **Dashed line**: forecasted values. They always start where the historical data ends.
- **Shaded band**: the lighter area around the line shows the potential range. A wider band means more volatility or uncertainty.
- **Badges above the chart**: summarize the absolute and percentage move versus the previous period so you do not have to calculate it yourself.

<Tip icon="eye">When the dashed line and the solid line overlap, use the legend to temporarily hide the forecast so you can focus on just the historical movement.</Tip>

## Controls you can use

1. **Time range** – Switch between 12, 24, 36, or 48 data points to zoom in on recent action or pull back for context.
2. **Chart settings** – Open the slider menu to toggle forecast, bandwidth, or the rolling average line on or off.
3. **Details drawer** – Click *Price details* to open commentary, methodology, and related cards without leaving the page.

Each change updates the chart instantly, making it easy to test a scenario while someone is asking the question.

## Data sources in plain language

- If the product trades frequently, you will see **weekly spot prices**.
- If it only settles monthly, the chart switches to **month-open averages** so there are no gaps.
- Localized product names ensure legends, tooltips, and exports all use the same label your team expects.

No manual formatting is needed—the system automatically handles currencies, locales, and number precision.

## Visual cues that help storytelling

- The y-axis always includes a buffer so the line never touches the frame, making presentations easier to read.
- Date labels automatically translate to the language set in your profile (e.g., German vs. English).
- Forecast sections include a subtle divider line to show where assumptions start, so stakeholders can see what is confirmed history versus projected.

Use these cues when narrating the chart: “Everything left of the divider is realized. Right of it is our forecast band.”

## Sharing tips

- Screenshot or export right after toggling the layers you care about. The chart remembers your choices until you refresh.
- Pair the chart with a board card if you want the same view inside a column—cards reuse the identical data pipeline.
- Add a link back to the live Insight page whenever you drop the chart into a doc so readers can interact with the controls themselves.
