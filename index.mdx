## What you’ll find here

- **Guided tours** of boards, cards, and the price history chart so new teammates can get oriented quickly.
- **How-to playbooks** for everyday tasks: creating boards, configuring cards, collaborating on insights, and sharing dashboards.
- **Reference sections** that decode terminology, data sources, and every badge or control you see in the app.

All pages are written for business users—no SQL or developer context needed. Keep Pricenxt open in another tab and follow along.
